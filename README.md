# Vegas Pro Clip Spacing
A script for Vegas Pro to add spacing between selected clips. The clips will be spaced evenly starting from the first one. Make sure there is enough room for the added pauses.

## Installation
* Download the script DLL file and move it to `[VEGAS-DIR]/Script Menu`, e.g. `c:\Program Files\VEGAS\VEGAS Pro 19.0\Script Menu\`
* If Vegas Pro is currently running, refresh scripts by **Tools > Scripting > Rescan Script Menu Folder** 

## Use
* In Vegas Pro, import media to your project or select events. The events must be selected before running the script.
* In the menu, open **Tools > Scripting** and select the script. You can also place the script on your toolbar.
* Enter the desired delay and confirm the dialog.
